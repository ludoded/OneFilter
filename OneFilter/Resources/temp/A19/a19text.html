    Hi,<br>
    I’m Jordan Price, creator of One Filter. I’m
    a <a href="http://www.jordanprice.com" >UI/UX designer</a>, <a href="http://www.cooljor.com" >graffiti artist</a>, and father
    based in San Francisco, California.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I love taking photos with my daughter,
    especially in black & white. While there
    are many b&w photo filter apps out there, I
    found them to be either too bloated with
    extra features, or they they would take
    too long to fire up, and precious moments
    would be missed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I created One Filter to be a fast, simple, and
    elegant solution to create beautiful black &
    white photographs on your iPhone. I want to
    help you capture beautiful moments forever.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Please feel free to <a href="#">reach out</a> and say hello.
    I’d love to hear from you!
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Happy memory creating!
    </p>
